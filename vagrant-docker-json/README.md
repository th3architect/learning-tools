# Running Multiple Docker Containers in Vagrant with JSON

These files were created to allow users to use Vagrant ([http://www.vagrantup.com](http://www.vagrantup.com)) to quickly and relatively easily launch multiple Docker ([http://www.docker.com](http://www.docker.com)) containers. The specifics of the Docker containers are specified in an external JSON file. The configuration was tested using Vagrant 1.8.1, VMware Fusion 8.1.0, and the Vagrant VMware plugin.

## Contents

* **containers.json**: This JSON file contains a list of the Docker containers and their properties for use by Vagrant. If you don't want to use the default values, you will need to edit this file to specify container friendly name, image, and exposed ports.

* **host/Vagrantfile**: This file is used by Vagrant to spin up a "host VM" for use with the Vagrant Docker provider. Edit this file to change the Vagrant box you'd like to use; by default, this Vagrantfile uses the "slowe/ubuntu-trusty-x64" box (built for the "vmware_desktop" provider).

* **README.md**: The file you're currently reading.

* **Vagrantfile**: This file is used by Vagrant to spin up the Docker containers on the host VM created by `host/Vagrantfile`. Unless you change filenames, you should not need to edit this file. All container details are stored in a separate JSON-encoded data file.

## Instructions

1. If you wish to use a box _other_ than my "ubuntu-trusty-x64" base box (running Ubuntu 14.04), edit the `Vagrantfile` in the `host` subdirectory.

2. Edit the `containers.json` file to specify the Docker containers that Vagrant should create on the host VM (specified by `host/Vagrantfile`). Each container should contain three properties: `name` (the friendly name to be assigned to the Docker container), `image` (the name of the Docker image to be used for this container), and `ports` (a list of ports to be exposed for the container).

3. From the directory where the main `Vagrantfile` is located, simply run `vagrant up` to spin up the specified host VM and specified Docker containers. Note that Internet access **will be** required to download Docker and the Docker images.

Enjoy!
